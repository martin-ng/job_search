## MVP

1. This web application will be a single page application. React is used for it virtual DOM and ability to keep the UI in sync with state.

2. The back-end will be developed using Node and JavaScript. This will allow for quick prototype as both the front-end and back-end will be written in the same programming language.

3. Express will be used on top of Node to create our RESTFUL APIs that will interface with public APIs to pull job openings.

4. Redis will be used to persist our data temporarily.

5. Cron in our Node module will be utilized to consistently pull jobs from public APIs at an interval.
